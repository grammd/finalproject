        <p>The aim of Nietzsche's Zarathustra, and in many ways his larger project, is not just to tear down idols and to conduct a revaluation of values, but to replace this with the ideal of the Overman (Übermensch). In this sense the overman is not a higher human being but transcends humanity altogether, and thus could never actually be achieved. The overman embraces the will to power, and the striving to overcome oneself. He creates new, life-affirming values as he sheds the morality of the herd.</p>

        <p>The last man, the Letzter mensch, is the antithesis of the overman. The last man embodies the current age, he is nihilistic, weary of the world, and seeks not to expand but to shrink himself, wanting only comfort and decadence. "The opposite of the overman [Übermensch] is the last man: I created him at the same time with that. Everything superhuman appears to man as illness and madness. You have to be a sea to absorb a dirty stream without getting dirty." This is the dichotomy of the last man and the overman, the personified dialectic which appears often in Nietzsche's work.</p>

        <h2>The Last Man</h2>
        <p>The last man is the embodiment of modern mediocrity. He is the one who says "we have invented happiness" and blinks. He is content with his small pleasures, his comfort, his security. He has no great desires, no great goals, no great suffering. He is the one who has made everything small and comfortable, who has eliminated all that is dangerous and challenging from life.</p>

        <p>"What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?" asks the last man, and blinks. He has made everything small and comfortable, and in doing so, he has made life meaningless. The last man is the one who has eliminated the possibility of greatness from human existence.</p>

        <h2>The Will to Power</h2>
        <p>The overman, in contrast, embraces the will to power—not power over others, but power over oneself. He is the one who constantly strives to overcome himself, to become something greater than he currently is. He creates new values, new meanings, new possibilities for human existence.</p>

        <p>The will to power is not about domination or control, but about self-overcoming. It is about the constant striving to become more than one currently is, to create new possibilities for human existence. The overman is the one who embraces this striving, who sees in it the possibility of greatness.</p>

        <h2>Beyond Good and Evil</h2>
        <p>The overman transcends the traditional moral categories of good and evil. He creates his own values, values that are life-affirming rather than life-denying. He does not accept the values of the herd, the values that have been handed down by tradition and religion.</p>

        <p>Instead, he creates new values based on his own experience and his own understanding of what makes life worth living. These values are not universal or absolute, but are specific to the individual who creates them. They are expressions of the individual's will to power, of his desire to create meaning in his own life.</p>

        <h2>The Eternal Recurrence</h2>
        <p>The overman is the one who can embrace the eternal recurrence, who can say "yes" to life in its entirety. He is the one who can accept that his life will recur infinitely, and who can find joy in this acceptance. He is the one who has created a life that he would want to live again and again.</p>

        <p>This is the ultimate test of the overman: can he embrace his own existence so completely that he would want it to recur eternally? Can he create a life that is so meaningful, so beautiful, so full of value that he would choose to live it again and again?</p>
